    <h1>Slow Smoked Lamb Shoulder with Herb Rub recipe</h1>
    <p>This smoked lamb shoulder recipe is a great way to mix up your typical barbecue.</p>

    <p>
        I decided to add a Mediterranean twist and served the lamb on warmed pita bread with hummus. 
        But if you can't get your hands on that you can't go wrong serving it on white bread with your favorite barbecue sauce.
