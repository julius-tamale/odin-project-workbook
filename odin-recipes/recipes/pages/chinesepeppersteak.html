    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound beef top sirloin steak</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 red onion, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <ol>
            <b>Step 1</b>
            <p>Slice steak into 1/2-inch thick slices across the grain.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <b>Step 2</b>
            <p>
                Whisk together soy sauce, sugar, cornstarch, and ginger in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Place steak slices into the marinade, and stir until well-coated.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <b>Step 3</b>
            <p>
                Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook steak strips in batches in hot oil so as not to crowd the pan. Cook and stir until well-browned, about 3 minutes, and remove steak from the wok to a bowl. Repeat with remaining steak, adding more oil as needed, and set the cooked meat aside.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <b>Step 4</b>
            <p>
                Return cooked steak strips to the hot wok, and stir in onion. Toss steak and onion together until onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes, then stir in green pepper. Cook and stir the mixture until peppers have turned bright green and started to become tender, about 2 minutes more, then add tomatoes. Stir everything together to mix and blend flavors, and serve.
            </p>
